# Wordle Clone
This is a command line application inspired by the NYT game, Wordle. You can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle#:~:text=Wordle%20is%20a%20web%2Dbased,or%20occupy%20the%20correct%20position.).

### How to play
The game randomly picks a 5 letter word from [this github](https://github.com/charlesreid1/five-letter-words/blob/master/sgb-words.txt) of 5,757 words. 
Then it prompts you to take a guess, your first of 5. 
* Green letter means you have the letter correct and it is in the correct spot
* Yellow letter means you have a correct letter, in the wrong spot
* Red letter means that letter is not in the answer at all.
